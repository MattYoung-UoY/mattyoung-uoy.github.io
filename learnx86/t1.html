			<h2>Tutorial 1: Hello World</h2><br/>
			
			<h3>Exit Codes:</h3><br/>
			
			As Assembly is so low level, some features that programmers may take for granted when using higher level languages are not available to us.
			One of these features is exiting our program properly.<br/>
			In higher level languages such as Java or Python, we can just let our code run to completion.
			However, if you have programmed in C, C++, etc. you may know that the main method returns an Integer.
			This is the exit-code for the program.<br/>
			Java and Python handle the exit-code for us at the end of the program.
			C and it's variants require us to return a value from the main method.<br/>
			However, neither of these are done for us when we are writing assembly code.
			To properly exit the program, we need to provide an exit code, and then use an interrupt to let the Operating System know that our program is finished executing.
			You may be able to just let the assembly program terminate without doing any of this, but I haven't tried it, and I wouldn't recommend it.<br/><br/>
			
			The first task was to write a program to test out returning an exit-code.
			The code for this is inside of the <a href="https://github.com/MattYoung-UoY/x86_tutorials_davy_wybiral/blob/master/tut1/ex1.s" id="niceln">ex1.s file</a> in the repository, as well as below:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
				.global _start<br/>
				_start:<br/>
				<tab/>mov $1, %eax<br/>
				<tab/>mov $42, %ebx<br/>
				<tab/>sub $29, %ebx<br/>
				<tab/>int $0x80<br/>
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			The first two lines deal with creating an entry point for the program.
			The ".global _start" makes the _start identifier available to the Linker.
			"_start:" creates a label that identifies a location in our code.<br/><br/>
			
			The following two lines load the integer values 1 and 42 into the General Purpose Registers eax and ebx respectively.
			The line of code "sub $29, %ebx" subtracts 29 from the value in the ebx register.<br/><br/>
			
			The last line "int 0x80" calls the interrupt handler.
			The hex number 0x80 tells the interrupt handler that we want to make a system call.
			The type of system call that is made is determined by the contents of the eax register.
			As the contents of the eax register is 1, the system call will be an exit call.
			The contents of the ebx register will be the exit-code for our program.<br/><br/>
			
			Executing the code requires a few steps:<br/>
			First we run the command "gcc -m32 ex1.s -o ex1.o".
			This uses the GCC Assembler to assemble our code.
			The "-m32" flag signals to GCC that instead of outputting the code for a 64-bit system (which is the default for my system as it is a 64-bit machine), it should output the code for a 32-bit machine.
			We need to do this as we are writing x86 assembly, and not x86_64 assembly.
			"ex1.s -o ex1.o" part of the command tells the assembler that ex1.s is the source file, and that it should output the Object File to a file called ex1.o.<br/><br/>
			The next command to run is "ld ex1.o -o ex1".
			This uses the ld program which is a linker to link our object file into an executable.
			"-o ex1" specifies that ex1 should be the name of the generated executable.<br/><br/>
			We can then run "./ex1" to run the code.
			Our code has now executed!<br/><br/>
			In order to see the exit-code of our program we can use the command "echo $?".
			When this command is used, the output is "13" which is the exit-code for our program (it was 42, but we then subtracted 29 to get 13).<br/><br/>
			
			<h3>Hello World:</h3><br/>
			
			So now we can run a basic shell program which will form the basis of all future x86 assembly programs.
			Our next step is to actually create the Hello World program.
			Here is the code:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
				global _start<br/><br/>

				.section .data<br/>
				msg:	.ascii "Hello, world!\n"<br/>
					<tab/>len = . - msg<br/><br/>
	
				.section .text<br/>
				_start:<br/>
					<tab/>mov $4, %eax<br/>
					<tab/>mov $1, %ebx<br/>
					<tab/>mov $msg, %ecx<br/>
					<tab/>mov $len, %edx<br/>
					<tab/>int $0x80<br/>
					<tab/>mov $1, %eax<br/>
					<tab/>mov $0, %ebx<br/>
					<tab/>int $0x80<br/>
				</div>
			</div><br/>

			<h2>Tutorial 1: Hello World</h2><br/>
			
			<h3>Exit Codes:</h3><br/>
			
			As Assembly is so low level, some features that programmers may take for granted when using higher level languages are not available to us.
			One of these features is exiting our program properly.<br/>
			In higher level languages such as Java or Python, we can just let our code run to completion.
			However, if you have programmed in C, C++, etc. you may know that the main method returns an Integer.
			This is the exit-code for the program.<br/>
			Java and Python handle the exit-code for us at the end of the program.
			C and it's variants require us to return a value from the main method.<br/>
			However, neither of these are done for us when we are writing assembly code.
			To properly exit the program, we need to provide an exit code, and then use an interrupt to let the Operating System know that our program is finished executing.
			You may be able to just let the assembly program terminate without doing any of this, but I haven't tried it, and I wouldn't recommend it.<br/><br/>
			
			The first task was to write a program to test out returning an exit-code.
			The code for this is inside of the <a href="https://github.com/MattYoung-UoY/x86_tutorials_davy_wybiral/blob/master/tut1/ex1.s" id="niceln">ex1.s file</a> in the repository, as well as below:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
				.global _start<br/>
				_start:<br/>
				<tab/>mov $1, %eax<br/>
				<tab/>mov $42, %ebx<br/>
				<tab/>sub $29, %ebx<br/>
				<tab/>int $0x80<br/>
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			The first two lines deal with creating an entry point for the program.
			The ".global _start" makes the _start identifier available to the Linker.
			"_start:" creates a label that identifies a location in our code.<br/><br/>
			
			The following two lines load the integer values 1 and 42 into the General Purpose Registers eax and ebx respectively.
			The line of code "sub $29, %ebx" subtracts 29 from the value in the ebx register.<br/><br/>
			
			The last line "int 0x80" calls the interrupt handler.
			The hex number 0x80 tells the interrupt handler that we want to make a system call.
			The type of system call that is made is determined by the contents of the eax register.
			As the contents of the eax register is 1, the system call will be an exit call.
			The contents of the ebx register will be the exit-code for our program.<br/><br/>
			
			Executing the code requires a few steps:<br/>
			First we run the command "gcc -m32 ex1.s -o ex1.o".
			This uses the GCC Assembler to assemble our code.
			The "-m32" flag signals to GCC that instead of outputting the code for a 64-bit system (which is the default for my system as it is a 64-bit machine), it should output the code for a 32-bit machine.
			We need to do this as we are writing x86 assembly, and not x86_64 assembly.
			"ex1.s -o ex1.o" part of the command tells the assembler that ex1.s is the source file, and that it should output the Object File to a file called ex1.o.<br/><br/>
			The next command to run is "ld ex1.o -o ex1".
			This uses the ld program which is a linker to link our object file into an executable.
			"-o ex1" specifies that ex1 should be the name of the generated executable.<br/><br/>
			We can then run "./ex1" to run the code.
			Our code has now executed!<br/><br/>
			In order to see the exit-code of our program we can use the command "echo $?".
			When this command is used, the output is "13" which is the exit-code for our program (it was 42, but we then subtracted 29 to get 13).<br/><br/>
			
			<h3>Hello World:</h3><br/>
			
			So now we can run a basic shell program which will form the basis of all future x86 assembly programs.
			Our next step is to actually create the Hello World program.
			Here is the code from the ex2.s file:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
				global _start<br/><br/>

				.section .data<br/>
				msg:	.ascii "Hello, world!\n"<br/>
					<tab/>len = . - msg<br/><br/>
	
				.section .text<br/>
				_start:<br/>
					<tab/>mov $4, %eax<br/>
					<tab/>mov $1, %ebx<br/>
					<tab/>mov $msg, %ecx<br/>
					<tab/>mov $len, %edx<br/>
					<tab/>int $0x80<br/>
					<tab/>mov $1, %eax<br/>
					<tab/>mov $0, %ebx<br/>
					<tab/>int $0x80<br/>
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			As before, we have a "global _start" instruction, and the last three lines that create an intrerrupt to exit the program.</br>
			First off I am going to focus on lines 3-5.
			".section .data" indicates to the linker that this part specifies data that is defined before executing the application.
			This makes sense as the next line "msg:	.ascii "Hello, World!\n"" creates a section in memory that stores the ASCII text "Hello, World!" followed by a newline character.
			"len = . - msg" is probably the most interesting part of the data section.
			This creates a label called len.
			Len is set to the integer that is represented by the expression ". - msg".
			The . means the current memory address that we are at, in this case, the memory address where len is located, which also happens to be right after the msg value.
			"- msg" subtracts the location in memory where the msg value is found.
			This expression results in the value that represents the length of the text that is contained in msg.</br>
			The next part that is new is the ".section .text" instruction. This simply tells the linker that the lines after this contain code that can be executed.</br>
			Next up is the first interrupt that we perform, which looks a bit different to the interrupts that we have performed before.
			As with the previous Interrupts that we used to stop the program, we load a value (in this case a value of 4) into the eax register.
			This signals that we are using the interrupt with ID 4, which is the Write Interrupt.
			This Interrupt takes three parameters, each stored in the ebx, ecx, and edx regsiters respectively.</br>
			The first parameter, stored in ebx, is the "file descriptor", which has been set to 1.
			This specifies what the Interrupt is meant to write to.
			In the case of the value of 1, this means to write to Standard Output, also known as the console.</br>
			The second parameter, stored in ecx, is a pointer to the "buffer" that stores the data that we want to write.
			In this case, it is the memory address provided by the msg label.</br>
			The last parameter which is stored in edx is the length of the data to write.
			For this program it is the length of the text that we want to write to the console.</br>
			Now that all of the code is written, we can compile and link our code and execute it.
			And when we do, we are greeted with the very simple, but much appreciated message of "Hello, World!".

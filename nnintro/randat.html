			<h2 id="title">Randomly Generated Datasets</h2><br/>
			I began by creating a new Eclipse project for the Perceptron program.<br/>
			The first class that I created was the Main class, which would contain the Main method.<br/>
			I then created the Classifier Functional Interface.
			This contains the public int classify(float x, float y) which would classify a certain 2D piece of data into an interger value.
			I chose to classify into integer values as this would allow me to classify boolean values (represented by 0 and 1) or multi-valued outputs, eg. colour (red = 0, blue = 1, green = 2, purple = 3, ...).<br/>
			After this, I created the DataPoint class.
			This class has two constructors. 
			The first one allows the user to specifiy the classification of that data point.
			The second one allows the user to specify the point and a Classifier implementation, and the constructor will use the Classifier to classify the data point.
			This class also has getters for the x, y, and classification values, as well as a toString method to allow for user-friendly printing of DataPoint objects.<br/>
			The last class to create was the DataSet class.
			This class contains a static method DataPoint[] genDataSet(float minX, float maxX, float minY, float maxY, int num, Classifier classifier).
			genDataSet returns an array containing num instances of the DataPoint class, each of which contain values from minX-maxX and minY-maxY inclusive.
			The generated data points are given the specified classifier so that they can be classified and used as training data.<br/>
			Then in the Main method I generated an array of 5 DataPoint instances and classified them using the ternary operator:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
				(x > y ? 0 : 1)<br/>
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			I then printed these values to confirm that the Random DataSet Generator was working.

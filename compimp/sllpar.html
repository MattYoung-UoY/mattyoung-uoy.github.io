			<h2 id="title">Straight Line Language Parser</h2><br/>
			
			<h3>Setup:</h3><br/>
			I downloaded the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/chap3/" id="niceln">skeleton code</a> as per usual. 
			I then set this up in an Eclipse environment.<br/><br/>
			
			<h3>Part 1 - Parser Specification:</h3><br/>
			I needed to set up a CUP specification that would produce the grammar for the Straight-Line Language(SLL). 
			This is easier said than done, as the grammar that is given to CUP (should) be unambiguous.
			As can be seen from the specification of the SLL in the <a href="cp1ex.html" id="niceln">SLL Interpreter</a>, the grammar production representing an Expression to an Arithmatic Operation is ambiguous:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					Exp -> Exp Binop Exp
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			This is the case as there are two different Parse Trees for the expression:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					1 + 1 + 1
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			This expression can be parsed in two different ways:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					(Exp Binop Exp) Binop Exp<br/>
					Exp Binop (Exp Binop Exp)
				</div>
			</div><br/>
	
			hence the ambiguity.<br/>
			We also have this issue with the grammar production that takes a Statement and produces a list of Statements:<br/><br/>

			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					Stm -> Stm ; Stm
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			The expressions that produce multiple different Parse Trees for this grammar production are of the same form as above and trivial, therefore I won't repeat my logic for this one as well.
			Hopefully the reader is able to see that this grammar production is also a cause of ambiguity in the grammar.<br/>
			
			When CUP reads these grammar productions, it does not know which method of parsing to use (the decision is Non-Deterministic).
			To fix this, we need to rewrite the grammar to be unambiguous.<br/>
			To fix the list of statements issue, I replace the above grammar production with:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					StmList -> Stm ; StmList<br/>
					StmList -> 
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			with StmList as the new starting Non-Terminal for the grammar.<br/>
			With a little mental gymnastics, the reader should be able to see how the Statement:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					Stm ; Stm ; Stm
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			now only has one Parse Tree, and therefore does not produce any ambiguity in the grammar.<br/>
			The case for the Arithmatic Operations is a little more complicated.
			The approach I take uses the concept of coercions from another tool called <a href="#" id="niceln">BNFC</a>.<br/>
			The following is the resulting grammar productions related to arithmatic expressions:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					exp -> exp SUB exp2<br/>
					exp -> exp2<br/>
					<br/>
					exp2 -> exp2 PLUS exp3<br/>
					exp2 -> exp3<br/>
					<br/>
					exp3 -> exp3 DIV exp4<br/>
					exp3 -> exp4<br/>
					<br/>
					exp4 -> exp4 MULT exp5<br/>
					exp4 -> exp5<br/>
					<br/>
					exp5 -> ID<br/>
					exp5 -> INT<br/>
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			This method not only produces a non-ambiguous grammar, but also provides a method of providing precedence for the different operators.
			However, at this stage, I cannot visualise how this ordering of the coercions will affect the resulting precedences, and so I will make adjustments after creating the system to create the Abstract Syntax Tree.<br/>
			After this, implementing the remaining grammar productions was trivial.
			If the reader wishes to view the final grammar specification, they can find it at <i>Striaght Line Language Implementation/src/parser/SllParser.cup</i><br/>
			I then generated the Java code using the CUP tool, and made some modifications to the resulting files to work with my project setup.<br/><br/>
			
			<h3>Part 2 - Abstract Syntax Tree Generation:</h3><br/>
			
			Now that I have a working parser, I need to implement the Semantic Actions to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree.<br/>
			The Semantic Actions are pieces of Java code that are specified alongside grammar productions in the CUP specification.
			They get executed whenever the production rule gets "used" by the parser, and so are perfect for generating the Abstract Syntax Tree.<br/>
			My first task is to decide which grammar productions need to produce nodes on the Abstract Syntax Tree. My decisions for which productions, and their corresponding values in the abstract syntax tree are shown here:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					stmList -> stm SEMICOLON stmList<br/>
					Statement<br/>
					<br/>
					stm -> assignID ASSIGN exp<br/>
					Assignment<br/>
					<br/>
					stm -> PRINT LPAREN expList RPAREN<br/>
					Print<br/>
					<br/>
					assignID -> ID<br/>
					ID<br/>
					<br/>
					exp -> exp SUB exp2<br/>
					Subtract<br/>
					<br/>
					exp2 -> exp2 PLUS exp3<br/>
					Plus<br/>
					<br/>
					exp3 -> exp3 DIV exp4<br/>
					Divide<br/>
					<br/>
					exp4 -> exp4 MULT exp5<br/>
					Multiply<br/>
					<br/>
					exp5 -> ID<br/>
					ID<br/>
					<br/>
					exp5 -> INT<br/>
					Int<br/>
					<br/>
					exp -> LPAREN stm COMMA exp RPAREN<br/>
					ExpSeq<br/>
					<br/>
					expList -> exp COMMA expList<br/>
					ExpList<br/>
					expList -> exp<br/>
					Exp<br/>
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			For each of these productions, a node will be created on a tree which will either be a leaf node, or will have child nodes.
			Nodes contain a token, and any child nodes that it may have.
			Tokens contain values eg. an INT token will contain the int value associated with it.<br/>
			To illustrate which actions I took for which productions, I will use the notation (TokID, Value, ChildNodes).
			TokID is the token to place in that node.
			Value is the value associated with that token.
			ChildNodes is the number of child nodes that the specified node should have.<br/>
			The Semantic actions for the chosen productions are:<br/><br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					Statement: (STM, null, 2)<br/>
					<br/>
					Assignment: (ASSIGN, null, 2)<br/>
					<br/>
					Print: (PRINT, null, getCounter())<br/>
					<br/>
					ID: (ID, id, null)<br/>
					<br/>
					Subtract: (SUB, null, 2)<br/>
					<br/>
					Plus: (PLUS, null, 2)<br/>
					<br/>
					Divide: (DIV, null, 2)<br/>
					<br/>
					Multiply: (MULT, null, 2)<br/>
					<br/>
					Int: (INT, num)<br/>
					<br/>
					ExpSeq: (EXPSEQ, null, 2)<br/>
					<br/>
					ExpList: incrementCounter()<br/>
					<br/>
					Exp: incrementCounter()<br/>
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			You will see that the final two productions call an incrementCounter function, and that the number of child nodes for the PRINT node is getCounter().
			This is because a PRINT statement contains an Expression List, which can have any number of expressions in it (at least one).
			This means that we need to count the number of expressions created with a counter variable.
			Whenever we parse an expression, we call incrementCounter() to increment the counter variable.
			Whenever we parse a Print statement, we call getCounter() to get the current value of the counter for the number of child nodes.
			A side effect of calling getCounter is that the counter variable is reset to 0, so that it is ready for the next Print statement.<br/>
			<br/>
			These generated nodes are placed on a stack.
			Whenever a node is created that requires child nodes, the number of child nodes is popped off the stack, and given to the new node.
			This new node is then placed on the top of the stack, and the next production is executed.
			Here is an example parsing of the expression a:=1+b*4; with the values on the stack at each step of the parsing:<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<div id="formcontainer">
				<div id="formulabox">
					Exp: a:=1+b*4;<br/>
					Stack:<br/>
					<br/>
					Exp: a:=1+b*4<br/>
					Stack:<br/>
					<br/>
					Exp: :=1+b*4<br/>
					Stack: ID(a)<br/>
					<br/>
					Exp: :=+b*4<br/>
					Stack: INT(1) ID(a)<br/>
					<br/>
					Exp: :=+*4<br/>
					Stack: ID(b) INT(1) ID(a)<br/>
					<br/>
					Exp: :=+*<br/>
					Stack: INT(4) ID(b) INT(1) ID(a)<br/>
					<br/>
					Exp: :=+<br/>
					Stack: MULT(ID(b), INT(4)) INT(1) ID(a)<br/>
					<br/>
					Exp: :=<br/>
					Stack: PLUS(INT(1), MULT(ID(b), INT(4))) ID(a)<br/>
					<br/>
					Exp: <br/>
					Stack: ASSIGN(ID(a), PLUS(INT(1), MULT(ID(b), INT(4))))<br/>
				</div>
			</div><br/>
			
			You may have noticed that the order in which the tokens are placed into the new token is the reverse of the order that they would be popped off of the stack in.
			This is because if we have a statement like a:=7-4 the order of the operands for the subtraction operator is important, and therefore has to be maintained.
			Hence why the order of the popped tokens is reversed before placing them in the new token.<br/>
			At the end of parsing, we should have just one node left.
			This is the root node of our Abstract Syntax Tree, which we can then use to traverse over the tree in later steps of the compiler.<br/>

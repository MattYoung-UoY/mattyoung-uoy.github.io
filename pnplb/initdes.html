			<h2>Initial Design</h2><br/>
			
			The board needed to be able to implement certain Digital Logic Functions, the main examples being Full Adders, and a variety of Flip-Flops.<br/><br/>
			
			Looking at the gates required, each Full Adder would require 2 XOR Gates, 2 AND Gates, and 1 Or Gate. A Full-Subtractor would require 2 NOT Gates in addition to these.<br/>
			Each Logic Gate Integrated Circuit (IC) can support 4 logic gates (with the exception of the NOT IC, which can support 6 NOT Gates).<br/>
			With this information, I decided I would use 2 of each of the XOR, AND, OR and NOT ICs.
			Only 1 OR IC is needed to implement the desired functions, but for the sake of symmerty (which may lead to easier design) I decided to include 2 ICs like the others.<br/>
			This will allow for the creation of a 4-bit Full Adder, which is a nice amount, and can be used as a convinient segway into the world of Hexadecimal Numbers.<br/><br/>

			<h2>Sustainable Folding At Home</h2><br/>
			Folding At Home (FAH) is a Distributed Computing service that processes simulations of protein folding.
			It is used by researchers to run simulations that they would not otherwise be able to run.
			Some of the primary pieces of research that FAH is used for is research into Cancer, and more recently, Covid-19.<br/>
			Once you have the hardware to run FAH, the only consideration is electricity costs.
			If you max out a high-end system, the power draw can result in a nasty surprise on your electricity bill!
			Therefore, the aim of this project is to take a system that can run FAH and use it to "Fold", whilst being powered by completely renewable sources.<br/>
			My choice of system is the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, as it has an onboard WiFi adapter so that the Pi can connect to the internet.
			My original plan was for the renewable power to be generated by a solar panel, however due to technical limitations, an alternative approach had to be taken...<br/><br/>
